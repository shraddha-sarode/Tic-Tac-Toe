# Tic-Tac-Toe
# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe - Web Game
A clean, interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a two-player game where players take turns marking the grid until one wins or the game ends in a draw.
## 🧠 Game Logic
The game board is a 3x3 grid made using HTML.
Players alternate between "X" and "O".
- A player wins if they get 3 of their marks in a row:
  - Horizontally
  - Vertically
  - Diagonally
- The game detects:
  - Win conditions
  - Draw when all cells are filled without a winner
The game offers a **Restart Game** button to reset the board and play again.
